# Machine-Forensics

This is quick script that can be run locally on any windows machines (as admin) to gather some initial triage information about a machine you believe to be infected. The script interrogates common methods and locations of persistence as well as common locations malicious files would be stored/called from.

Usage:
```
PS> .\MachineForensics.ps1 -SaveFolder C:\Temp\Forensics
```
